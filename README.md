# Pathfin-D-er: Interactive Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

Pathfin-D-er is an interactive visualization tool designed to explore and understand Dijkstra's Algorithm, a popular pathfinding algorithm. This tool allows users to visualize how Dijkstra's Algorithm works on customizable grids, providing an educational and engaging way to see the algorithm in action.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Visualize how Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes.
- **Obstacle Placement**: Add obstacles(walls) to the grid to challenge the pathfinding algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with a clear and intuitive interface.
- **Customizable Start and End Points**: Set your own start and end points to see how the algorithm adapts.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm's progress in real-time.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of Pathfin-D-er [here](https://pathfin-d-er.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Pathfin-D-er locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfin-d-er.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pathfin-d-er
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage
1. **Select Start and End Points:** Enter the desired x-y coordinates to place the start (green) and finish (red) nodes on the grid.
2. **Add Obstacles:** Click on the grid to place obstacles (black) that the pathfinding algorithm must navigate around.
3. **Run the Algorithm:** Click the "Visualize" button to see Dijkstra's Algorithm in action.
4. **Observe the Process:** Watch how the algorithm explores the grid and finds the shortest path from the start to the end point.
